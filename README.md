# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
This is my thrid web development. This generates a map with several pins which represent active MBTA buses. The pins will move every 10 seconds and reflect the new updated coordinates of the bus.
This project pulls live data from the MBTA data source and is used to represent the real time location of the buses, now i'm tring to add directional arrow to point where the bus is heading.
